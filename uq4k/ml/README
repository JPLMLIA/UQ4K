Not a full readme file but the qoi_miniball.py file contains the code needed to run the blackbox optimization with the minimum enclosing ball algorithm
on the California housing data set with a standard linear regression model. The quantity of interest used is one dimensional in the form of the predicted
value of one of the houses that wasn't in the set used to train the model. Ideally, the functions should be able to be used or only very slightly tweaked
for compatability with other models and other quantities of interest.
